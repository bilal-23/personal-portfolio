## Need of portfolio for a developer ☝️

- Professional way to showcase your work

- Shows you’re more than just a resume

## Getting Started 🚀

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites 📋

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

## How To Use 🔧

From your command line, first clone Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/bilal-23/personal-portfolio

# Go into the repository
$ cd personal-portfolio

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:
